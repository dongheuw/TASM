# TASM

Prototype implementation of TASM, which is a tile-based storage manager video analytics. See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02958) for more details.

# Cloning
`git clone https://github.com/uwdb/TASM.git`  
`cd TASM`  
`git submodule init`  
`git submodule update`  

# Building Docker container
`docker build -t tasm/environment -f docker/Dockerfile.environment  .`
`docker build -t tasm/tasm -f docker/Dockerfile .`  

# Running the example notebook in the Docker container
By default, the Docker container opens to the `python/Examples` directory which comes with a notebook that walks through
the basics of interacting with TASM. 

On the machine with an encode-capable GPU (https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new#Encoder):   
1. `docker run --rm -it --runtime=nvidia -p 8890:8890 --name tasm tasm/tasm:latest /bin/bash`  
2. `jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8890 --allow-root &` (in the Docker environment)
 
On the machine where you want to interact with the notebook
(e.g., the Docker container is running on a remote machine, but you want to view the notebook locally):  
- Note: I've only tried this on Mac through XQuartz  
1. `ssh -X -L 8890:127.0.0.1:8890 <user>@<host>`
2. Paste the link from the `jupyter notebook` command into a web browser

# Example usage

### The key parameters to TASM's API are:
- `video`: The name of the stored video (e.g., "birds-untiled" or "birds-2x2" or "birds-birds")
- `label`: The label associated with a bounding box in the semantic index (e.g., "bird")
- `metadata_id`: The metadata identifier associated with the labels and bounding boxes in the semantic index (e.g., "birds"). Multiple stored videos can use the same `metadata_id` (e.g., all of "birds-untiled", "birds-2x2", and "birds-birds" can use the same `metadata_id = "birds"` if the semantic content of all of these videos is the same).

`python3`  

```
import tasm

t = tasm.TASM()

# Add metadata for a video.
t.add_metadata(metadata_id, label, frame, x1, y1, x2, y2)

# Store a video without tiling.
t.store("path/to/video.mp4", "stored-name")

# Store a video with a uniform tile layout.
t.store_with_uniform_layout("path/to/video", "stored-name", num_rows, num_cols)

# Store a video with a non-uniform tile layout based on a metadata label.
# This leads to fine-grained tiles being created around the bounding boxes associated with the specified label.
# A new layout is created for each GOP. 
t.store_with_nonuniform_layout("path/to/video", "stored-name", "metadata identifier", "metadata label")

# Store with a non-uniform tile layout, but do not tile GOPs where the layout is not expected to improve query times.
# This estimation is based on the number of pixels that have to be decoded to retrieve the specified metadata label.
t.store_with_nonuniform_layout("path/to/video", "stored-name", "metadata identifier", "metadata label", False)

# Retrieve pixels associated with labels.
selection = t.select("video", "metadata identifier", "label", first_frame_inclusive, last_frame_exclusive)

# The metadata identifier does not have to be specified when it matches the name of the stored video.
selection = t.select("video", "label", first_frame_inclusive, last_frame_exclusive)

# Specify a single frame to select from.
selection = t.select("video", "label", frame)
selection = t.select("video", "metadata identifier", "label", frame)

# Select all instances of the object on all frames.
selection = t.select("video", "metadata identifier", "label")

# Select entire tiles that contain objects.
selection = t.select_tiles("video", "metadata identifier", "label")  
or selection = t.select_tiles("video", "metadata_identifier", "label", first_frame_inclusive, last_frame_exclusive)

# Select entire frames.
selection = t.select_frames("video", "metadata identifier", "label")  
or selection = t.select_frames("video", "metadata identifier", "label", first_frame_inclusive, last_frame_exclusive)

# Inspect the instances. They are not guaranteed to be returned in ascending frame order.
# If is_empty() is True, then there are no more instances/tiles/frames.
while True:
    instance = selection.next()
    if instance.is_empty():
        break

    width = instance.width()
    height = instance.height()
    np_array = instance.numpy_array()

    # To view the instance.
    plt.imshow(np_array); plt.show()

# To incrementally tile the video as queries are executed.
# If not specified, the metadata identifier is assumed to be the same as the stored video name.
# The threshold indicates how much regret must accumulate before re-tiling a GOP. By default, its
# value is 1.0, meaning that the estimated reduction in decoding time must exceed the estimated cost
# of re-encoding the GOP with the new layout.
t.activate_regret_based_tiling("video")
t.activate_regret_based_tiling("video", "metadata identifier")
t.activate_regret_based_tiling("video", "metadata identifier", threshold)
    
< perform selections >

# Re-tile any GOPs that have accumulated sufficient regret.
t.retile_based_on_regret("video")

    - Tested on 15 minute videos with 2K and 4K resolutions from the perspective of static traffic cameras.
    - Tested on 2K videos generated from a car's POV.


## Future enhancements:
- Expose an API toggle to choose between fine-grained and coarse-grained tile layouts.
- Support H264-encoded videos. Currently only HEVC-encoded videos are encoded.
- Reduce duplicated work when retrieving pixels from decoded frames.
